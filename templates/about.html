    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
    <p>The Review is your guide to exceptional books, providing you with all you need to know reviews the books that
        matter.
        For more than two decades, The Review has provided a curated resource of the best in contemporary fiction and
        nonfiction, with an emphasis on books that not only engage and entertain but also deepen our understanding of
        ourselves and the world around us. We offer free and premium content - with subscription options for individuals
        and libraries (so that all patrons and staff can access.)
        Because there are far too many books published for you to read reviews all of them, let alone read them all, we
        seek out and recommend only the best of the best. Then, we give you all the information you need to decide which
        books are just right for you. Among much else, The Review provides in-depth reviews and "beyond the book"
        articles; hand-selected read-alike recommendations for thousands of books and authors; the ability to browse by
        genre, time period, setting and a wide range of themes; previews of notable books publishing soon; and extensive
        resources for book clubs.
        We also publish four free newsletters (The Review Highlights, Publishing This Week, Book Club News and Librarian
        News) and, for our members, a twice-monthly e-magazine, The Review.

    <h4>The Review Story</h4>  
    <p> In the years before children, one of our greatest pleasures was going together to browse the shelves in the
        bookstore or library, taking our time to pick out books that looked interesting and browsing a few pages to
        decide which we wanted to take home. But after the arrival of our two children, lengthy visits to anything other
        than the kid's section became rare.
        Back in 1997, we arrived home from a far from relaxing visit to the bookstore (because the four year old wanted
        to go off exploring and the two year old decided that an afternoon nap wasn't on the agenda after all). Surely,
        we thought, there must be another way, and perhaps this newfangled thing called the world wide web was the
        answer? So, we dialed up our internet connection and started to search for information on books - but it was so
        limited - even at Amazon, all that was available was the book jacket description.
        We asked ourselves, why can't we browse through a few pages of a book online just as we can in the bookstore or
        library? And, finding we could not, we resolved to create a website that would bring booklovers excerpts of
        books. But that was just the start...
    </p> 

    <h4>Browse the Best - Ignore the Rest!</h4>  
    <p> Fast forward to the early 2000s. The internet was growing exponentially, as was the number of books published -
        far more than anyone could read, or even read reviews! So we became increasingly selective reviews the books we
        listed - only featuring books that we could wholeheartedly stand behind.
        For a book to capture our interest, then and now, it has to do more than just tell a good story, it also needs
        to give us a window to explore the lives of others, or a mirror to reflect on our own experiences. In short, it
        needs to not just entertain and engage, but also inform, leaving us knowing something new. Such books aren't
        limited to any individual genre, so we feature books from a wide range of genres, both fiction and nonfiction.
